# Kubernetes Attack Surface - Slides
Slides from my last talk on Kubernetes Attack Surface at Berlin Security Meetup 27-02-2020

Feel free to share them around. Keep in mind that I just started exploring Kubernetes Security Aspects at the end of November, so if you think something is not accurate, feel free to let me know.
Also, I would recommend having a look at the sources/tools/references I attached to the slides, this is where the real information can be retrieved that laid the foundation for the slides I created.
